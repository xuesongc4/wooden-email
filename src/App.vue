                        "body": "Congratulations on making the intentional effort to become the very best you were meant to be. Partnering with the greatest coach of all time—UCLA legend, Coach John Wooden—is an excellent decision to help you on your development journey. The Wooden Way is the path of a great coach, first in your own development, and then in the opportunity and privilege to serve and develop those that may be entrusted to your care and influence in the future.<br><br>Coach Wooden began just as you are, with the desire to become the best person, teacher, and coach he could possibly be. His initial efforts focused on being clear on what it meant to be a success. He recalled what his dad, Joshua Wooden, had told him and his brothers: “Never try to be better than someone else, but never cease to be the best you can be.” He also remembered a class discussion he was part of that concluded that success was the attainment of wealth and status or a position of power and influence. He remembered this but didn’t really buy into that idea. He was more comfortable with the thinking of his teacher at that time who suggested that real success could only come from “peace of mind”.<br><br>As a teacher himself, Wooden knew success was more than a good grade. As an athlete and coach, he learned success was more than winning and losing. He finally concluded that four things were essential for true success. And all four were things that you could control. First was peace of mind. Second was self-satisfaction. Third was giving your very best effort. Fourth was coming as close as possible to reaching your potential, and ultimately doing your best, based on what you are capable of doing. <br><br>John Wooden’s effort to understand true success lead to his own definition of success: “Success is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.”<br><br>It also led to 14 years of work and study that produced the blueprint for how his definition of success could be achieved: The Pyramid of Success.",

                        "title": "Industriousness",
                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s design for his Pyramid of Success included 25 carefully arranged blocks. He believed these personal traits or behavior characteristics were essential to achieve success as he defined it: “Success is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.” He believed that these 25 characteristics represented a behavioral blueprint for producing the habits and discipline that lead to success. <br><br>Coach Wooden spent 14 years fine-tuning his Pyramid. His Pyramid started with two blocks he called the cornerstones, Industriousness and Enthusiasm. These two blocks anchored the foundation. Everything that has strength and lasts must be built on a strong foundation.<br><br>Industriousness, the first block, means the most productive kind of hard and smart effort. “Worthwhile results come from hard work and careful planning.” Every day Coach Wooden operated with this question in mind: “What is the most that can be accomplished with maximum effort and the most efficient use of time?” That is Industriousness. Forget the tricks and the shortcuts. They fail to develop the strengths and potential that lies within you, and every team. Learn to enjoy the hard work; work builds strength and strength creates endurance and builds character.<br><br>Understand that lack of effort means missed opportunity. To reach your potential you must make your best effort every day. Do not think you can make up for a lack of effort today by working harder tomorrow. Strive for perfection not just in what work can accomplish. Seek perfection in the type of work that produces the best result; that is industriousness. Coach Wooden looked at every job, drill, and task with this idea in mind: “Do not mistake activity for achievement.”<br><br>The effort invested, the time spent on the job, the activity, the task, must produce the outcome desired. If not, stop doing it. Change it. Improve it. Don’t just be busy. Be industrious.",
                        "conclusion": "Week Two Conclusion: To be a true success, you cannot mistake activity for achievement. Make sure the hard work you are being asked to do and the hard work you are investing your time to do, has the best opportunity to produce the results needed.",

                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s definition of Industriousness includes two important elements:  hard work and careful planning. “Hard work is essential, of course. Careful planning is equally important to the definition.” <br><br>Careful planning is the thing that most likely turns hard work with maximum effort into Industriousness. Careful planning should focus on four specific and complementary elements:<br>1. Doing the right things (no activity without achievement);<br>2. In the right amount of time at the right time;<br>3. For the correct outcomes (be sure of the why);<br>4. In the very best way possible (be precise with the how).<br><br>Coach Wooden thought, believed, practiced, and taught that anything worth doing is worth doing well, the best it can be done. This approach to work creates a habit of excellence. Excellence is on the road to the perfection of many small details. This attention to detail begins with quality planning. Two things Coach Wooden mastered were his ability to plan and the discipline to keep improving his planning.<br><br>Case in point, his practice plan. He essentially used the same plan (timing, drills, execution, etc.) his entire career.  He never stopped trying to improve how it was executed. He conducted a two-hour planning meeting with his assistants for every two-and-a-half-hour practice they conducted. Everything was thoroughly reviewed every day. Quick notes were made during practice on 3x5 cards. All notes were reviewed, logged, and kept.<br><br>The goal for all that planning effort was find improvements in the details that would help the process, the coaches, the team, and the players get a little better every day. Everyone’s input was essential. Listening was key. Planning never stopped. Wooden knew that not all change is progress, but there is no progress without change.",

People around you will receive what you are sending out, and likely respond in kind. Second, you must love what you do, and what it does for you and possibly others. Remember we don’t live to work—we work to live. You must enjoy what you do.<br><br>Enthusiasm is married to Industriousness because you cannot force yourself to work hard and smart for any meaningful period of time if you don’t love what you do. Enthusiasm is the spark, the catalyst that takes plain work to a higher level. Your heart must be in the work, for your mind and body to work at their potential.<br><br>To do your best, be your best, and seek to get the best from others, enthusiasm must drive your will. Enthusiasm does not look the same or act the same for every person. People are different and so is enthusiastic behavior. It stems from a love and passion for what you are doing. It is always positive and optimistic. It is intense and energetic. It always stems from the clear choices that can be made every day, in every situation, by any person.",

However, if we do enjoy our work and we are enthusiastic about doing it, we will do better. And we are more likely to do it our very best. We are more productive when we do the tasks we like to do. <br><br>As a professional, you may really love all the excitement, pressure, and challenge of the bigger moments of your work. When the lights turn on, so do you. You may be less enthusiastic about the everyday routine of preparation, planning, minding the details or doing some of the mundane tasks that are part of every job in life. Those things just don’t hold the same kind of magic. <br><br>That was not the case for Coach Wooden. He loved to teach, and his enthusiasm, intensity, and energy always came through. He was passionate about preparation and planning, and the practice court was his classroom. Not only to teach the skills and intricacies of the game, but just as importantly to teach the lessons of life. Games were fun for sure, but it was practice where his genuine enthusiasm came out. <br><br>Enthusiasm is born out of a positive, optimistic attitude. Something Coach Wooden learned when his father taught him the three Don’ts: don’t whine, don’t complain, don’t make excuses. Just do the best you can, with the way things are and the way things turn out.<br><br>Enthusiasm is the outward evidence of the inward interest, inspiration and passion.

Cooperation is getting along and going along for the benefit of all. This is such a key element of cooperation. If you are just getting people to cooperate to try and get your way, you will find difficulty every time. People are smart and see through selfish ambition and perceived manipulation quickly.<br><br>Real cooperation can only happen when it is focused on a common goal. It must serve the common interest of the majority of people you need for something to work well. It may seem ironic, but no individual can reach their full potential without cooperation from others.<br><br>You have to listen to others to cooperate. The more you listen to others, the more likely they are to listen to you. That is why Coach Wooden counseled to “listen if you want to be heard”. A good listener is interested in finding the best way to get something important done, for the good of the group. Not selfishly looking for a clever means to have their own way. “Others too have brains.” <br><br>Disagreements will result but that doesn’t mean people have to be disagreeable.

You need Self-control to keep you focused on the most productive kind of work—that is industriousness. Maintaining self-control is essential to keep friendships healthy and thriving.<br><br>Self-control is a necessary, delicate balance between your mind, body, and emotions. For everyone seeking to be their best, physical acts or mental decisions have a much greater chance to be workable and productive. Physical skills are more repeatable at a higher level of performance in the “zone” of self-control. Too much emotion can cause reason to fly out the window. Failing to maintain self-control leads to poor judgement, lack of common sense and often to serious trouble.<br><br>Self-control is self-discipline. It starts with how you think and how you discipline yourself to monitor and control the things that most affect and shape your thinking. If your thinking is improperly focused, essentially out of control, it won’t be long till your behavior will follow the same path.<br><br>Coach Wooden practiced a remarkable level of self-discipline when it came to his thinking. He used a passage from the Bible as both a guide and a standard: “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things,” Philippians 4:8.

It is part of the reason he never believed in fiery, emotional speeches pre-game that might stir emotions to a sudden peak. He preferred to maintain a gradually increasing level of both performance and emotion. He wanted to avoid creating artificial emotional highs. He felt every false peak created a subsequent valley. Self-control provides emotional stability and fewer valleys.<br><br>Self-control is self-discipline at work. You discipline to help, to correct, to prevent and to improve. Not to punish, embarrass or retaliate. When you punish you are likely to antagonize; you cannot get the most positive results when you antagonize. Self-control is essential to avoid the excessive negative emotions that are likely to antagonize. When emotions are high and self-discipline is low, judgement and common sense are going to suffer. Nothing good is likely to happen next.<br><br>Self-control also keeps you in the present. You cannot let yesterday or tomorrow take up too much of your today. Today is all you have to work with, what you have control over; that, and control of yourself. You may think that as a parent or supervisor or coach or teacher, that you can exercise control over others. Perhaps you can for a brief period, but that time passes quickly.

Not to be afraid of failure, but to know you can learn from failure. People with initiative are smart because they act using the information and experience they have. And they act with self-control. If you have initiative then you move forward without fear of failure, even though you could make mistakes and fail. <br><br>Everybody does fail. No one is perfect and gets everything right every time. So failure becomes perhaps our best teacher.

But what Lambert was teaching Wooden was that doers make mistakes; mistakes of commission, not of omission or of carelessness. You have to be a doer. Mistakes shape learning and adversity and you get stronger and better with adversity. Wooden believed and practiced in a way that challenged everyone to always push to the very edge of potential. Wooden learned that is where growth occurs, adversity teaches, and greatness lies.<br><br>Mistakes are great teachers for everyone, if you use them in a positive way. Recognize mistakes quickly, admit them freely, learn from them immediately, and forget them.
