Partnering with the greatest coach of all time—UCLA legend, Coach John Wooden—is an excellent decision to help you on your development journey. The Wooden Way is the path of a great coach, first in your own development, and then in the opportunity and privilege to serve and develop those that may be entrusted to your care and influence in the future.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden began just as you are, with the desire to become the best person, teacher, and coach he could possibly be. His initial efforts focused on being clear on what it meant to be a success. He recalled what his dad, Joshua Wooden, had told him and his brothers: “Never try to be better than someone else, but never cease to be the best you can be.” He also remembered a class discussion he was part of that concluded that success was the attainment of wealth and status or a position of power and influence. He remembered this but didn’t really buy into that idea. He was more comfortable with the thinking of his teacher at that time who suggested that real success could only come from “peace of mind”.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher himself, Wooden knew success was more than a good grade. As an athlete and coach, he learned success was more than winning and losing. He finally concluded that four things were essential for true success. And all four were things that you could control. First was peace of mind. Second was self-satisfaction. Third was giving your very best effort. Fourth was coming as close as possible to reaching your potential, and ultimately doing your best, based on what you are capable of doing. \r\n\r\nJohn Wooden’s effort to understand true success lead to his own definition of success: “Success is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.”\r\n\r\nIt also led to 14 years of work and study that produced the blueprint for how his definition of success could be achieved: The Pyramid of Success.",

                        "title": "Industriousness",
                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s design for his Pyramid of Success included 25 carefully arranged blocks. He believed these personal traits or behavior characteristics were essential to achieve success as he defined it: “Success is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.” He believed that these 25 characteristics represented a behavioral blueprint for producing the habits and discipline that lead to success. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden spent 14 years fine-tuning his Pyramid. His Pyramid started with two blocks he called the cornerstones, Industriousness and Enthusiasm. These two blocks anchored the foundation. Everything that has strength and lasts must be built on a strong foundation.\r\n\r\nIndustriousness, the first block, means the most productive kind of hard and smart effort. “Worthwhile results come from hard work and careful planning.” Every day Coach Wooden operated with this question in mind: “What is the most that can be accomplished with maximum effort and the most efficient use of time?” That is Industriousness. Forget the tricks and the shortcuts. They fail to develop the strengths and potential that lies within you, and every team. Learn to enjoy the hard work; work builds strength and strength creates endurance and builds character.\r\n\r\nUnderstand that lack of effort means missed opportunity. To reach your potential you must make your best effort every day. Do not think you can make up for a lack of effort today by working harder tomorrow. Strive for perfection not just in what work can accomplish. Seek perfection in the type of work that produces the best result; that is industriousness. Coach Wooden looked at every job, drill, and task with this idea in mind: “Do not mistake activity for achievement.”\r\n\r\nThe effort invested, the time spent on the job, the activity, the task, must produce the outcome desired. If not, stop doing it. Change it. Improve it. Don’t just be busy. Be industrious.",
                        "conclusion": "Week Two Conclusion: To be a true success, you cannot mistake activity for achievement. Make sure the hard work you are being asked to do and the hard work you are investing your time to do, has the best opportunity to produce the results needed.",

                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s definition of Industriousness includes two important elements: hard work and careful planning. “Hard work is essential, of course. Careful planning is equally important to the definition.” \r\n\r\nCareful planning is the thing that most likely turns hard work with maximum effort into Industriousness. Careful planning should focus on four specific and complementary elements:\r\n1. Doing the right things (no activity without achievement);\r\n2. In the right amount of time at the right time;\r\n3. For the correct outcomes (be sure of the why);\r\n4. In the very best way possible (be precise with the how).\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden thought, believed, practiced, and taught that anything worth doing is worth doing well, the best it can be done. This approach to work creates a habit of excellence. Excellence is on the road to the perfection of many small details. This attention to detail begins with quality planning. Two things Coach Wooden mastered were his ability to plan and the discipline to keep improving his planning.\r\n\r\nCase in point, his practice plan. He essentially used the same plan (timing, drills, execution, etc.) his entire career. He never stopped trying to improve how it was executed. He conducted a two-hour planning meeting with his assistants for every two-and-a-half-hour practice they conducted. Everything was thoroughly reviewed every day. Quick notes were made during practice on 3x5 cards. All notes were reviewed, logged, and kept.\r\n\r\nThe goal for all that planning effort was find improvements in the details that would help the process, the coaches, the team, and the players get a little better every day. Everyone’s input was essential. Listening was key. Planning never stopped. Wooden knew that not all change is progress, but there is no progress without change.",

People around you will receive what you are sending out, and likely respond in kind. Second, you must love what you do, and what it does for you and possibly others. Remember we don’t live to work—we work to live. You must enjoy what you do.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm is married to Industriousness because you cannot force yourself to work hard and smart for any meaningful period of time if you don’t love what you do. Enthusiasm is the spark, the catalyst that takes plain work to a higher level. Your heart must be in the work, for your mind and body to work at their potential.\r\n\r\nTo do your best, be your best, and seek to get the best from others, enthusiasm must drive your will. Enthusiasm does not look the same or act the same for every person. People are different and so is enthusiastic behavior. It stems from a love and passion for what you are doing. It is always positive and optimistic. It is intense and energetic. It always stems from the clear choices that can be made every day, in every situation, by any person.",

However, if we do enjoy our work and we are enthusiastic about doing it, we will do better. And we are more likely to do it our very best. We are more productive when we do the tasks we like to do. \r\n\r\nAs a professional, you may really love all the excitement, pressure, and challenge of the bigger moments of your work. When the lights turn on, so do you. You may be less enthusiastic about the everyday routine of preparation, planning, minding the details or doing some of the mundane tasks that are part of every job in life. Those things just don’t hold the same kind of magic. \r\n\r\nThat was not the case for Coach Wooden. He loved to teach, and his enthusiasm, intensity, and energy always came through. He was passionate about preparation and planning, and the practice court was his classroom. Not only to teach the skills and intricacies of the game, but just as importantly to teach the lessons of life. Games were fun for sure, but it was practice where his genuine enthusiasm came out. \r\n\r\nEnthusiasm is born out of a positive, optimistic attitude. Something Coach Wooden learned when his father taught him the three Don’ts: don’t whine, don’t complain, don’t make excuses. Just do the best you can, with the way things are and the way things turn out.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm is the outward evidence of the inward interest, inspiration and passion.

So can speaking to another person first. If you hesitate or wait, it may not happen, and a potential friendship could be lost.\r\n\r\nHave a sincere liking for all people; it demonstrates respect and begins the process for mutual esteem and devotion. Coach Wooden’s counsel to be more concerned with loving than being loved, giving than receiving, being a friend than having a friend, is sound advice.

That means working and striving together on the basis of mutual esteem, mutual respect and devotion.\r\n\r\nHumans were created to be interdependent.

Cooperation is getting along and going along for the benefit of all. This is such a key element of cooperation. If you are just getting people to cooperate to try and get your way, you will find difficulty every time. People are smart and see through selfish ambition and perceived manipulation quickly.\r\n\r\nReal cooperation can only happen when it is focused on a common goal. It must serve the common interest of the majority of people you need for something to work well. It may seem ironic, but no individual can reach their full potential without cooperation from others.\r\n\r\nYou have to listen to others to cooperate. The more you listen to others, the more likely they are to listen to you. That is why Coach Wooden counseled to “listen if you want to be heard”. A good listener is interested in finding the best way to get something important done, for the good of the group. Not selfishly looking for a clever means to have their own way. “Others too have brains.” \r\n\r\nDisagreements will result but that doesn’t mean people have to be disagreeable. If you are not open to the thinking of others, and you are always the smartest person in the room, you are likely in the wrong room and hanging out with the wrong people.\r\n\r\n",

You need Self-control to keep you focused on the most productive kind of work—that is industriousness. Maintaining self-control is essential to keep friendships healthy and thriving.\r\n\r\nSelf-control is a necessary, delicate balance between your mind, body, and emotions. For everyone seeking to be their best, physical acts or mental decisions have a much greater chance to be workable and productive. Physical skills are more repeatable at a higher level of performance in the “zone” of self-control. Too much emotion can cause reason to fly out the window. Failing to maintain self-control leads to poor judgement, lack of common sense and often to serious trouble.\r\n\r\nSelf-control is self-discipline. It starts with how you think and how you discipline yourself to monitor and control the things that most affect and shape your thinking. If your thinking is improperly focused, essentially out of control, it won’t be long till your behavior will follow the same path.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden practiced a remarkable level of self-discipline when it came to his thinking. He used a passage from the Bible as both a guide and a standard: “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things,” Philippians 4:8. Coach Wooden did think about such things, constantly, and it helped him maintain self-control during the heated moments of a sports contest and through the everyday challenges of life. \r\n\r\n",

It is part of the reason he never believed in fiery, emotional speeches pre-game that might stir emotions to a sudden peak. He preferred to maintain a gradually increasing level of both performance and emotion. He wanted to avoid creating artificial emotional highs. He felt every false peak created a subsequent valley. Self-control provides emotional stability and fewer valleys.\r\n\r\nSelf-control is self-discipline at work. You discipline to help, to correct, to prevent and to improve. Not to punish, embarrass or retaliate. When you punish you are likely to antagonize; you cannot get the most positive results when you antagonize. Self-control is essential to avoid the excessive negative emotions that are likely to antagonize. When emotions are high and self-discipline is low, judgement and common sense are going to suffer. Nothing good is likely to happen next.\r\n\r\nSelf-control also keeps you in the present. You cannot let yesterday or tomorrow take up too much of your today. Today is all you have to work with, what you have control over; that, and control of yourself. You may think that as a parent or supervisor or coach or teacher, that you can exercise control over others. Perhaps you can for a brief period, but that time passes quickly.

Initiative takes the information and signals you picked up using your Alertness behavior and gives you the opportunity to decide to take action: the first steps of Initiative. Initiative is having the courage and confidence to take that first step and move from dreams to goals.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden challenges you to make decisions and think alone. Not to be afraid of failure, but to know you can learn from failure. People with initiative are smart because they act using the information and experience they have. And they act with self-control. If you have initiative then you move forward without fear of failure, even though you could make mistakes and fail. \r\n\r\nEverybody does fail. No one is perfect and gets everything right every time. So failure becomes perhaps our best teacher. Particularly when it comes to showing us how to avoid repeating our mistakes and failures.\r\n\r\nThrough failure and often the adversity it brings, we learn, we grow stronger, we become more capable and better people. We likely come a little closer to realizing our full potential. Coach Wooden memorized a little poem that reminded him of these principles:\r\n“When I look back, it seems to me,\r\nAt all the grief that had to be,\r\nLeft me when the pain was o’er,\r\nStronger than I was before.” *\r\n\r\nLike Coach Wooden you need very keen alertness when it comes to taking initiative.

But what Lambert was teaching Wooden was that doers make mistakes; mistakes of commission, not of omission or of carelessness. You have to be a doer. Mistakes shape learning and adversity and you get stronger and better with adversity. Wooden believed and practiced in a way that challenged everyone to always push to the very edge of potential. Wooden learned that is where growth occurs, adversity teaches, and greatness lies.\r\n\r\nMistakes are great teachers for everyone, if you use them in a positive way. Recognize mistakes quickly, admit them freely, learn from them immediately, and forget them. In doing your best, if you decide to show initiative, act with good self-control based on careful planning and good information, and if things do not turn out like you hoped, it does not mean you made a bad decision.

He decided to hold Condition in place with two strong elements of the human spirit: adaptability to any circumstances; and resourcefulness, which means exercising common sense and good judgement.\r\n\r\nYou must learn to consistently do the things it takes to get and keep the mind, body and spirit at the peak of fitness. Also understanding the need and having the will and discipline of making choices to avoid anything that tears down the body, corrupts the mind, and destroys a peaceful, kind and loving spirit. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden often stated that,” you can do more good by being good than any other way.” Being good meant the need for moderation and balance in everything. You can develop your own philosophy, methods and means to get in great condition. Or you may need help with a coach, facilities and a support group. But either way, just do it! \r\n\r\nFor Coach Wooden that meant being very clear on the vast difference between better and best. For you it means do not fall into the trap of comparisons. Focus on doing your best and being your best, never worrying what someone else does or how they might look. Also, be enthusiastic about all the opportunities to improve your conditioning. Your mind, your spirit and soul are in the long run the most important areas for peak conditioning. Invest enough time, love and effort in those. As much or more as you do your physical conditioning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In fact, if he had to choose between skill and experience, he stated that he would rather have a lot of skill and less experience than a lot of experience and very little skill. \r\n\r\nSkill, to Coach Wooden, was not just how well you did something, but more so, how quickly you could do something well. He taught how to do things properly first, and then quickly. Have patience—get things right, then get things moving faster. That applies to nearly everything in your work and in your life. Everything starts with proper execution of the basic fundamentals of everything we learn to do. No detail is too small to consider, to learn, to teach and to perfect. Preparation is the key to everything. \r\n\r\nSkill comes after condition on the Pyramid. Our skill development is likely to come easier and faster if we are conditioned to learn and develop desired skills. Improving conditioning and fundamental skills at the same time is genius. Find a way to combine the two. Some people teach and believe that practice makes perfect. Coach Wooden taught and believed that only a perfect practice creates perfection. If you want to improve your skills, improve how you practice those skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You will be hard pressed to do it for others until you know how to consistently do it for yourself. \r\n\r\nThere are several things that helped Coach Wooden bring out the best in himself and others. Recognize that you and every individual you work with has a certain potential. Your responsibility and opportunity is first to self-coach. Giving your best effort, doing your very best based on your capability is what Coach Wooden calls “true success”. It’s what produces peace of mind and self- satisfaction. Improvement comes from the fundamentals; be great at your job. Tell yourself, “I will get ready and perhaps my chance will come.” Your chance will come and your opportunity to get even closer to realizing your potential. That will of course provide the opportunity to help others realize their potential. You see it, you have the potential to be a great coach because you can teach and lead. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

An eagerness to sacrifice personal glory for the welfare of all. \r\n\r\nTo Wooden, very few things were as important as the team concept. No player or coach was above the team. The star of the team was the team. Is that kind of thinking true about you? Do you sense or see that kind of teamwork where you work? Embracing your role on the team was paramount to Coach Wooden. Every role was vital. As a teammate doing your best and helping teammates be their best was as good as it could get. Can you relate to these two big ideas? Team Spirit is the ultimate expression of depending on each other. \r\n\r\nTeam Spirit rests on Initiative and Intentness on the Pyramid of Success. That means there is no hesitation to do whatever the team needs. And no one ever lets up or gives up, and will eagerly sacrificing personal interests for the accomplishment of team goals. Is that the kind of team you are on, or would like to be on? That means there is no room for selfishness, egotism or envy. A favorite quote Coach Wooden connected to team spirit: “Happiness begins where selfishness ends.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It’s easy to understand this when you consider a contemporary definition of Team Culture: “patterns of accepted, desirable behaviors, and the character, beliefs, and values, that create, strengthen and promote them.” \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden had everything he needed to create great team culture: The Pyramid of Success defines perfect team behavior, and shapes good character. His coaches and parents had given him a strong foundation of beliefs and values that taught consideration and respect for everyone. He set the example every day of sacrificing for others and always deferring any credit for success to his players and staff. \r\n\r\nHe modeled what it meant to always put the “we” ahead of the “me”. Are these things you see in your culture at work? Have you experienced and celebrated team performance even in the presence of great individual performance? Wooden was pleased that his most celebrated individuals were also great team players. They had learned that individuals may achieve honors and recognition, but it took a team to win championships. Companies and organizations are much the same if they are to grow and thrive. \r\n\r\nAs a former member of the U.S. Navy during World War II, Wooden had learned what team spirit looked like when our country’s freedom was at stake. For that reason, Wooden believed that “patriotism” was team spirit in its grandest and most important form. Is this still true today? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Poise is a composite, a result. \r\n\r\nSeems simple based on Coach Wooden’s definition of poise—just being yourself, just being you. But do you feel you know who you really are? Are you still finding out? Are you comfortable with who you think you are so far? Wooden taught that when we have poise, we are not faking or acting or pretending to be something we are not, or someone we are not. Nor are we trying to live up to someone else’s expectations. \r\n\r\nWooden believed and practiced that when we are being who we really are, we have a better chance of functioning nearer our own level of competency. Being yourself eliminates the guesswork. It gets complicated always trying to figure out who you think you are supposed to be, or who you think someone else expects you to be. Do you get worried that maybe you don’t fit in? Or perhaps you are trying too hard to stand out? Maybe you think people won’t like or respect you if they know who you really are? Poise keeps you true to yourself. And the real you is the person good people will like and respect. The real you is the only one of its kind.

But more so directing the best of yourself at those things that are truly worth fighting for. \r\n\r\nPoise connects to competitive greatness, and that is where the fight comes in. Directing your best to enjoy a difficult challenge. When you have poise, outside influences and outside pressure does not change who you are, what you are trying to be, or what you seek to accomplish. Poise also depends heavily on two nearby behavior blocks, self-control and confidence, which are primary components of poise. \r\n\r\nA poised person has the ability to take a deep breath, compose themselves, and stay in complete control at all times. They can do that because they have the confidence that comes with thorough preparation and the discipline of self-control. That kind of poise also enables you to not be focused on yourself, and gives you the opportunity to see how others can be helped, served, and developed.

Shouldn’t confidence be one of the foundation blocks, maybe even a cornerstone? \r\n\r\nIn Coach Wooden’s definition of confidence, he does not tell you what confidence is. He tells you what it could create in you and in others: respect. He shares the possibility of how it might be attained, with total preparation. And he shares a state of mind that promotes confidence, keeping all things in proper perspective. \r\n\r\nHis placement near the top, right next to poise, teaches us a few good things can come out of confidence—competitive greatness for one. Patience and faith are two others. Confidence is a mental, physical and emotional state of readiness. You think you know when you have it. You definitely know when you don’t have it. Confidence occurs when all the behavior below confidence on the Pyramid of Success tells you that you are well prepared. \r\n\r\nNot being prepared is a sure predictor of mediocre performance and possibly complete failure.

That belief fostered a daily discipline of reading and prayer that was intentional to keep his faith practical, growing and strong. That likely helps to explain why, when he constructed his Pyramid of Success, he placed Faith and Patience at the pinnacle of the Pyramid resting on Competitive Greatness. \r\n\r\nCoach often said that “you must have faith that things are going to turn out as they should.” That does not mean that things will turn out as you want them to turn out, but you must have faith that they will. For this to come about, you must do everything within your effort and power to help your faith become a reality. For you, this may mean faith in yourself—faith where you find strength and guidance, and in something or someone greater than yourself. \r\n\r\nJohn Wooden believed in the God of the Bible. You may not. He also believed that either God was in control or he wasn’t. You may or may not have that same view on control, but Coach Wooden chose to believe that God was in control. Coach also believed that God gives us free will to make choices, and delegates many responsibilities to us. One of those responsibilities is the development and strengthening of our faith. Faith is spiritual muscle. You must work to develop it. You must go through adversity to strengthen it. You must put faith into work. You must have faith in the effort and work you put in. \r\n\r\nBecause Coach Wooden taught at a public institution, he did not talk about his faith. He never felt it was appropriate. He intentionally led by example, based on what his faith had taught him. He attempted to demonstrate what his faith had taught him by the way he lived his life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And oh, by the way, we also must be patient. But we will save that for another lesson. \r\n\r\nWe also see in the construction of the Pyramid of Success that faith is one of five pieces of mortar that Coach placed to cement all the other important blocks in place. In fact, at the top, faith becomes the fullest extension of what we call that left side of mortar, “the force of the human spirit”: Ambition, Adaptability, Resourcefulness, Fight, and then Faith. \r\n\r\nYou can certainly relate to the importance of those four qualities, which we will teach in coming emails. But for now, know that you have to fight for the things you believe in, the things you have faith in. As Coach Wooden practiced faith, that certainly represented a powerful force for good at work. As you fight for the things you believe in—know for sure, the same will be true. \r\n\r\nIt was very important to Coach Wooden to never come across as someone who was critical of what someone else might believe. He never questioned another person’s faith. It never bothered him if someone believed differently, or if their faith was just as strong as his. He never tried to change another person’s faith. That was not his job. He did encourage his players to have faith, to be able to defend their faith, and to stay open-minded. As was his customary approach, you don’t tell people what to think, you teach them how to think. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In fact, with Coach Wooden as an example, True Success for anyone may take a lifetime. \r\n\r\nJohn Wooden described patience as the ability to wait and calmly persevere; to him that meant to continue in a course of action even in the face of difficulty. He learned these lessons early as a young man on the family farm. He was taught about a time to plant, a time to cultivate, weed and water. And barring any major disaster, a time to harvest. The planting, watering, weeding and cultivation are always hard work, but without those stages, there is no harvest. \r\n\r\nFor anyone, whether it is acquiring a set of skills, building a career, developing good friends, raising a family, creating financial security—the same principles apply.

That path is day to day improvement. Easy to say, but much, much harder to do, staying on course and staying constructively optimistic. In an increasingly impatient world, where the desire for instant recognition, winning at all costs, fame and fortune, has never been more pressing, patience seems to be in short supply. It is harder and harder to wait and to keep others waiting for the necessary progress to reach the end result. \r\n\r\nIt is also difficult in an instant gratification culture, to have the proper perspective needed to balance getting what you want—perhaps what might feel good right now—with the more important task of developing over time, who you are and what you need to build the skills needed to create a meaningful, purpose-filled life. Coach Wooden often told the story about famous football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, who was once asked after a very successful season, “Well Coach, How did you think your season went?” His answer: “Well, I won’t really know for about twenty years.” \r\n\r\nYou may have been lucky enough to have had a coach or mentor or parent who had that same perspective: waiting patiently to see your progress as a good person building a good life.

If we are going to invest time carefully planning and working hard, then that effort should be focused on doing things that really matter. \r\n\r\nAccomplishing things that are noble goals will take the self-discipline, good judgement and common sense required to exhibit self-control. Ambition connects to Adaptability on the Pyramid, which tells us we will have to be adaptable in many ways to accomplish our noble goals. \r\n\r\nWhat are things that represent noble goals? Coach Wooden believed you are most likely to succeed when your intentions, your ambition, is focused on worthy purposes and outcomes rather than goals that are set out of selfishness. How do you know the difference? Here was Coach Wooden’s yardstick: If your ambition is to be highly publicized, widely recognized, attain a position of power or prestige, or make a lot of money, you likely do not have noble goals. \r\n\r\nIf you are focused away from yourself, focused on your family, on your staff, your community, on helping others get along and get ahead, then you possess noble goals. When you possess noble goals, you prioritize the bigger picture. Having noble goals means you are taking others along on your climb up the Pyramid of Success. \r\n\r\nSo, what you are ambitious about determines whether ambition is good or bad.

Winning 10 National Championships in 12 years certainly proves his point. But he also says that he would have been at ease if he had not won a championship, because his significance and self-worth were never attached to winning. He just wanted himself as a person, and his team and players to improve. Winning championships is defined differently for every person. How attached you are to winning becomes a central question. He believed his championships came as a by-product of meeting lesser goals of measurable year-over-year improvement.\r\n\r\nHis vision was to get the best possible players, and help them become the best they could be as people, citizens, and players on a team. He also set goals for constant improvement for the team. He was always keeping personal goals and noble goals in balance.

Adaptability is the will to act, making needed adjustments to any situation at any given time.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden often remarked that there are only three things you can really count on in life: death, taxes, and change.

He thought that life itself and the “seasons “of life pointed to the critical nature of the need for adaptability. From your birth and childhood, through your youth, adulthood, careers and families, and the end of life, all are a season in life. Each season brings about change, much of which we cannot control. If you fail to adapt, you fail to move forward. Being adaptable and flexible is a must. Not only as you move from one season to another, but as you try to make the best of every day. For Coach Wooden that meant “make each day your masterpiece”.\r\n\r\nAs a person seeking success, making the best of each day means you are adapting to so many things. Every day brings the need for adaptability. The people you are working with, new friends, a new boss, the opportunities you have, shifting cultural norms, new priorities and goals, changing health, conflicting values, social media—what a dynamic it all creates!\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the changing circumstances this dynamic creates, you must be constantly surveying your situation and then making necessary adjustments. Random adjustments on the fly are less effective than adjustments to a solid life plan. Planning is preparation that builds confidence for being adaptable. Planning will help you anticipate changes that could come.\r\n\r\nYou change what you can, when you can. But you cannot get so engrossed in circumstances over which you have no control, that it takes time and energy away from changes you can make. Ultimately things happen, changes occur. You have to recognize and accept reality and move forward. In fact, things will always turn out best for those who make the best of how things turn out. That takes Adaptability!\r\n",

That thinking called for resourcefulness to find answers that fit the different circumstances and different people.\r\n\r\nEvery day at work and in life, circumstances arise that represent opportunities and challenges. Those circumstances always involve other people in your life. You work with, live with, and engage with others that are either part of the solutions you seek to make your life and the lives of those around you better; or those persons are likely making excuses for not getting the job done. It is the creative energy, effort and ideas spawned by resourceful people that keep things focused on solutions. Resourceful people make things happen for themselves and for others. \r\n\r\nIt was American Ambassador and Statesman Dwight Morrow who stated, “There are no hopeless situations, only hopeless people.” With resourcefulness, there is always the opportunity to find the will, forge the way, and spawn hope. Resourcefulness can provide an answer at any time, that can come from anywhere, and from any person. Coach Wooden always sought after and respected the thinking and solutions of others.

In his very first coaching job, on his very first day as a football coach in Dayton, Kentucky, fight must have meant something different. It was something he got into, with one of his players. The greatest coach in history, by his own admission, got his coaching career off to a slow start. \r\n\r\nFight is the fourth of five behaviors on the left side of the Pyramid that we refer to as the “strength of the human spirit”. Fight puts resourcefulness to work, taking action that only a poised person would take. Fight brings the effort, energy, and will to take on the challenges of Competitive Greatness. Fight is capped off by Faith. \r\n\r\nWhen you have Fight, you are always ready to respond. When you coach, you are challenged to instill fight in others, so they will respond with their very best. Respond quickly but don’t hurry. You and your team will make fewer mistakes, because your level of intensity is under control. Fight is that bright but contained fire burning within. The fire emerges as focused passion. Coaches, teams and players who have this kind of fight will never lose a game. They just run out of time to pull out the victory. \r\n\r\nIn considering, coaching and instilling fight, it’s important for you as a coach to establish the rules and boundaries for you team to engage in the fight. That means knowing the difference between being hurt, and being injured. People with fight will play hurt, with pain. That is okay. Sometimes they will play injured, and risk further injury. That is not okay. As a coach full of fight and filled with love, you might have to rein back that player who is up for the fight when they should not be.",

He knew the word has some negative connotations that he did not want to communicate. The word conjures up images of two people or two companies, or perhaps even two countries going against each other. He is being crystal clear when he states, “in no way is this mortar quality about beating or fighting an opponent”. There was a time when he talked about being better than someone else, but he stopped that. He remembered his father’s advice, “never try to be better than someone else, but never cease to be the best you can be.” He always wanted to win, but the fight was never with an opponent. The fight was always within himself. Fight was the struggle inside to bring the passion, energy and effort it took to be the best you can be. Wooden’s view was there is no such thing as losing when you give the effort to do the best you can. If you use Fight and determination to give your very best, winning and success will take care of itself. Determination is the key idea; it is having that iron will, and a clear sense of purpose it takes to “never say never”. As one of the mortar blocks that holds Competitive Greatness in place, Fight means you welcome and even relish adversity, and situations that could bring adversity. Adversity builds both moral and competitive strength. Fight means you are never afraid of failure. Because of that you will seldom have to face it. Fight enables you to mentally and physically get ready for your most challenging situations. Fight puts that confident smile on your face as you tell yourself: “I got this”.

Sincerity helps assure that those interactions will be positive and productive. Coach Wooden was not totally sure that sincerity would make you a friend. He was convinced, however, that sincerity is essential to keep your friends.\r\n\r\nIt often takes time to know who someone really is. Can they be trusted? Are they consistent in their values and actions? Do they say what they mean and mean what they say? Can you count on them to do what they say they will do? When you see that people are sincere in thought, word and actions, you more than likely respond by giving back what you have been given.\r\n\r\nAs a military man, John Wooden had seen that soldiers following a sincere leader would do more for them than for an insincere one, especially under fire. He found sincerity worked the same way with an athletic team, and in the business world. People will always give more to a manager or leader who really cares about them, than one just using them and the opportunity to get ahead themselves. A person in leadership, teaching or supervision can only give their best when they sincerely care for those they have the privilege to serve. When people believe their manager or supervisor really cares about them as individuals, they will make an effort to get closer to their personal best.

Sincerity is not a guarantee that all personal relationships will be positive and strong.\r\n\r\nInsincerity, however, is very likely a guarantee that communication between people will not be meaningful and any relationship is likely to be shallow. As an English teacher, Wooden was a master with the English language. He knew the word “sincere” comes from the Latin sine cera, meaning “without wax”. It was the custom in ancient Rome for wax to be used as a cheap filler to cover up shoddy workmanship for a potter or sculptor.

Combined with the desire to be reliable, honesty drives the integrity it takes to never make compromises with your values and principles. Honesty means you don’t lie to others or to yourself. A dishonest act is always a selfish act. It is always an attempt to deceive someone for personal gain in some way. It might be to get something you want, or to protect something you have, or to keep someone else from taking advantage of you, or to provide a payback for something done to you.\r\n\r\nDishonesty, no matter the reason, destroys your credibility, ruins your reputation, and ultimately costs you your self-respect. With peace of mind the ultimate reward for true success, the cost of dishonesty could not be higher.\r\n\r\nSince Honesty rests between Intentness and Team Spirit, Coach Wooden teaches us how important Honesty is in a high performing, team environment. Maximum effort focused on realistic goals, resisting the temptations that undermine achievement, and individuals sacrificing personal interests for the good of the team, will never take place if any dishonesty plagues the team.

Mostly he resisted. But he does recount several incidents where he was not very proud of his own not very Pyramid-of-Success-like behavior.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, an opposing coach kept sending the wrong shooter—a better shooter—to the free throw line. He got away with it several times so Coach Wooden set his honesty aside and tried it. He got caught. He was embarrassed, certainly. But he was more regretful for giving in to the temptation, and not staying true to his standards.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he violated college basketball rules when he bailed Bill Walton out of jail. He broke the rules to do what he thought was best for the player. He never tried to hide the fact. He was prepared to face the consequences. He felt he was honest about both his reasons and his actions.\r\n\r\nWooden believed and taught that being tempted to be dishonest is not the problem. Everyone faces temptation quite often. The lesson is how to resist the temptation when it comes. Resisting temptation is a conscious act, carried out by disciplined thinking. Disciplined thinking is developed based on referencing strong core values. When consistently applied, those values will trigger and guide disciplined behavior.\r\n\r\nHonesty is always the best policy, as the saying goes. Coach Wooden learned that very early when his dad gave him a set of three Nevers: Never Lie, Never Cheat, Never Steal! He also learned Honesty is the best therapy. It makes you feel good about who you are. That explains why he was fond of the maxim “there is no pillow as soft as a clear conscience”.",

They model what reliability is all about. John Wooden demonstrated that with two hours of preparation for every two-hour practice with his staff.\r\n\r\nReliability creates mutual respect. The kind of respect that produces dependendability and consistency. Parents teach their children and managers teach their employees to give their best, and to do their best in every situation.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden learned so many early lessons on what reliability looks like on an everyday basis from his first coaches: his parents. Their hard work, steadfastness, and consistency during very trying times, even when they lost the family farm, demonstrated they would be there for their family, no matter what.\r\n\r\nWooden saw the same admirable behavior from the three coaches—Warner, Curtis and Lambert—who shaped his coaching philosophy. As a great player who became a great coach, Wooden could never fathom the idea of letting somebody down.\r\n\r\nHe tried to teach his players that this meant so much more than just showing up for practice and games. As representatives of the University, the community, and the team, it also meant never putting yourself in a position where your character and behavior compromise your values. You could never do something that would let those people down who are depending on you. His advice “discipline yourself so others won’t need to” reinforced the importance of reliability.",

Many people have the best of intentions to do the right things, but just never quite follow through and never get the job done. It is the combination of intention and action that really makes the difference. That is why Coach Wooden was fond of the quote: “the smallest good deed is better than the best intention”.\r\n\r\nReliability is also not to be confused with capability. Coach Wooden did not think capability had anything to do with reliability. In fact, his experience as a coach and leader strengthened that notion. He had players who may have been less capable, but their reliability, their consistency of action and effort often made up for their state of less God-given talent.\r\n\r\nWorking with people, you can likely relate to Coach Wooden’s experience. Knowing what you are going to get every day from people you work with is invaluable. You know what you can count on. On the other hand, excellent talent that comes with inconsistent performance always makes the job more difficult.\r\n\r\nReliability is a trademark behavior of good character. Coach Wooden often remarked “ability may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep you there”. Reliability eliminates the idea that you can ever rest on your laurels.

Purity of intention, as Coach Wooden understood it, was always a reflection of the condition of your heart and soul.\r\n\r\nIt means being true to your values, your guiding principles and core beliefs. It means always having a clear conscience. Integrity pulls from other character qualities and reflects sincerity, honesty and reliability.

Coach Wooden felt, and experienced, that the more the quality of integrity was represented in the make-up of his team, the better their team play would become.\r\n\r\nGreat players who lacked integrity didn’t usually form great teams, but there were some exceptions. Wooden had great players who were everything he hoped they would be on the court. They were reliable, committed, high performers. But off the court, he sometimes saw examples of “selective integrity”, choices that were made, and actions taken, that kept someone from being all they could be off the court.\r\n\r\nThe quality of integrity, Coach Wooden thought, is best reflected when someone is genuinely concerned with the betterment of others. In his mind, the integrity of commitment, to regard others as more important than yourself, is really what sets someone apart.\r\n\r\nCoach Wooden had five examples or role models he would reference when it came to integrity: Jesus, Joshua Wooden, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, and Billy Graham. Very high standards for anyone to emulate certainly, but worthy of giving your best effort. Coach Wooden especially liked how Mother Theresa expressed it: “a life not lived for others is not a life”.\r\n\r\nLiving a life for others means we are whole, complete, unimpaired.

He has shared this unique success behavioral blueprint that took 14 years to finalize, and seven decades to practice, perfect, and prove its immense worth.\r\n\r\nNow as a reminder for you, and a summary of the Pyramid of Success, we answer a question. Coach Wooden was asked and answered many times with always the same response: Can a person truly achieve Success by following the Pyramid of Success? How does that happen?\r\n\r\n“Well, of course you can. If you are industriousness, giving your best effort and having a plan. If you have enthusiasm, loving what you do. If you have and value friendship and show loyalty to someone and some things. If you practice cooperation, always wanting to find the best way, not always interested in having your own way.\r\n\r\n“If you maintain self-control and use good judgement, always showing alertness, taking initiative, and setting and accomplishing realistic goals. You must of course maintain condition, mental, moral and physical, and have the skills to do things not only quickly, but properly. You must have team spirit, always showing consideration for others.\r\n\r\n“All the qualities mentioned will provide the poise to just be yourself, and the confidence it takes for competitive greatness; enjoying the difficult challenge and being your best when your best is needed. But all this will not happen overnight. It takes a spirited person of strong character, who has the faith, to know things will work out when you do what you must to bring success about. And it always requires patience. True Success takes time and it should!”",

Partnering with the greatest coach of all time—Coach John Wooden, UCLA legend—is an excellent decision to help you on your development journey. The Wooden Way is the path of a great coach, first in your own development, and then in the opportunity and privilege to serve and develop those that have been entrusted to your care and influence. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden began just as you are; with the desire to become the best teacher and coach he could possibly be. His initial efforts focused on being clear on what it meant to be a success. He recalled what his dad, Joshua Wooden, had told him and his brothers: “Never try to be better than someone else, but never cease to be the best you can be.” He also remembered a class discussion he was part of that concluded that success was the attainment of wealth and status or a position of power and influence. He remembered this but didn’t really buy into that idea. He was more comfortable with the thinking of his teacher at that time who suggested that real success could only come from “peace of mind”. \r\n\r\nAs a teacher himself, Coach Wooden knew success was more than a good grade. As an athlete and coach, he learned success was more than winning and losing. He finally concluded that four things were essential for true success. And all four were things that you could control. First was peace of mind. Second was self-satisfaction. Third was giving your very best effort. Fourth was coming as close as possible to reaching your potential, and ultimately doing your best, based on what you are capable of doing. \r\n\r\nJohn Wooden’s effort to understand true success led to his own definition of success: “Success is peace of mind attained only through the self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.” It also led to 14 years of work and study that produced the blueprint for how his definition of success could be achieved: The Pyramid of Success.",

                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s design for The Pyramid of Success includes 25 carefully arranged blocks. He believed these personal traits, or behavior characteristics, are essential to achieve success as he defined it: “Success is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.” He believed that these 25 characteristics represented a behavioral blueprint for producing the habits and discipline that lead to success. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden spent 14 years fine-tuning his Pyramid. It started with two blocks he called the cornerstones: Industriousness and Enthusiasm. These two blocks anchored The Foundation. Everything that has strength and lasts must be built on a strong foundation. \r\n\r\nIndustriousness, the first block, means the most productive kind of hard and smart effort. Every day, Coach Wooden operated with this question in mind: “What is the most that can be accomplished with maximum effort and the most efficient use of time?” That is industriousness. Forget the tricks and the shortcuts. They fail to develop the strengths and potential that lies within every person, and every team. Learn and teach others to enjoy the hard work; work builds strength, strength creates endurance and builds character. Strive for perfection, not just in what work can be accomplished, but seek perfection in the type of work that produces the best result. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden looked at every drill and task with this idea in mind: “Do not mistake activity for achievement.” The effort invested, the time spent on the drill, the activity, and the teaching, must produce the outcome desired. If not, stop doing it. Change it. Improve it. Don’t just be busy, be industrious.",

                        "body": "Coach John Wooden’s definition of Industriousness includes two important elements: hard work and careful planning. “Hard work is essential of course. Careful planning is equally important to the definition.” Careful planning is the thing that turns hard work with maximum effort into Industriousness. Careful planning should focus on four specific, complementary elements: 1. Doing the right things (no activity without achievement); 2. In the right amount of time, at the right time; 3. For the correct outcomes (be sure of the why); 4. In the very best way possible (be precise with the how). Coach Wooden thought, believed, practiced, and taught that anything worth doing is worth doing well, the best it can be done. This approach to work creates a habit of excellence. Excellence in the small details leads to perfection. Attention to detail begins with quality planning. Two things Coach Wooden mastered were his ability to plan and the discipline to keep improving his planning. Case in point: his practice plan. He essentially used the same plan (timing, drills, etc.) his entire career. He never stopped trying to improve how it was executed. He conducted a two-hour planning meeting with his assistants for every two-and-a-half-hour practice they conducted. Everything was thoroughly reviewed each day. Quick notes were made during practice on 3x5 cards. All notes were reviewed, logged, and kept. The goal for all that planning effort was to find improvements in the details that would help the process, the coaches, the team, and the players get a little better every day. Everyone’s input was essential, listening was key, and planning never stopped. Wooden knew that not all change is progress, but there is no progress without change.",

People around you will receive what you are sending out, and likely respond in kind. Second, you must love everything about coaching—the attention to detail required, the passion to continually learn, and especially the people you are privileged to serve. Enthusiasm is married to Industriousness because you cannot force yourself to work hard and smart for any meaningful period of time if you don’t love what you do. Enthusiasm is the spark, the catalyst that takes plain work to a higher level. Your heart must be in the work for your mind and body to work at their potential. To do your best, be your best, and seek to get the best from others, enthusiasm must drive your will. Enthusiasm does not look or act the same for every coach. People are different and so is enthusiastic behavior. It stems from a love and passion for what you are doing. It is always positive and optimistic. It is intense and energetic. It also stems from the clear choices that can be made every day in every situation, by any person.",

However, if we do enjoy our work and we are enthusiastic about doing it, we will do better. And we are more likely to do our very best. We are more productive when we do the tasks we like to do. As a coach and leader, you may really love all the excitement, pressure, and challenge of game coaching. When the lights turn on, so do you. You may be less enthusiastic with the everyday routine of practice, preparation, and planning. It just doesn’t hold the same kind of magic that games hold. That was not the case for Coach Wooden. He loved to teach, and his enthusiasm, intensity, and energy always came through. He was passionate about preparation and planning, and the practice court was his classroom. Not only to teach the skills and intricacies of the game, but just as importantly to teach the lessons of life. Enthusiasm is born from a positive and optimistic attitude. Something Coach Wooden learned when his father taught him the three Don'ts: Don’t whine, don’t complain, don’t make excuses.

Don’t take friendship for granted. Work at making friends and work at making friendships flourish. The element of Friendship involves the risk of possible rejection. But for a Friendship to occur someone has to be brave enough to offer friendship first. Doing good things for another without any thought of something in return can be a catalyst for friendship; so can speaking to another person first. If you hesitate or wait, it may not happen, and a potential friendship could be lost. When you have a sincere liking for all people, it demonstrates respect and begins the process for mutual esteem and devotion. Coach Wooden’s counsel to be more concerned with loving than being loved, giving than receiving, being a friend than having a friend, is sound advice. Be a friend and you will have friends. As Coach Wooden learned from someone he looked up to, Abraham Lincoln, friendship is also a very good way to eliminate your enemies: “You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him.”",

That means working and striving together on the basis of mutual esteem, mutual respect, and mutual devotion. \r\n\r\nHumans were created to be interdependent. Teams are formed to focus interdependence on worthy ambition, purposeful goals, and synergistic performance. Interdependence becomes stronger and more meaningful wrapped in the bonds of friendship.

Loyalty is a foundational behavior that gets people, teams, and families through difficult times. In difficult times, we often are tested to compromise those things and those people we hold closest. Loyalty keeps us true and strong in the face of temptation. \r\n\r\nWe never have to, or should want to, sacrifice our beliefs, our values, or most importantly, our relationships for short term gains or pleasures.

Cooperation is getting along and going along for the benefit of all. This is such a key element of cooperation. If you are just getting people to cooperate to try and get your way, you will find difficulty every time. People are smart and see through selfish ambition and perceived manipulation quickly. \r\n\r\nReal cooperation can only happen when it is focused on a common goal that serves the common interest of the majority of people you need for something to work well. It may seem ironic, but no individual can reach their full potential without cooperation from others. \r\n\r\nYou have to listen to others to cooperate. The more you listen to others the more likely they are to listen to you. That is why Coach Wooden counseled to “listen if you want to be heard”. A good listener is interested in finding the best way to get something important done, for the good of the group, not selfishly looking for a clever means to have their own way: “Others too have brains”. \r\n\r\nDisagreements will result but that doesn’t mean people have to be disagreeable. If as the coach, you are not open to the thinking of others, and you are always the smartest person in the room, you are likely in the wrong room and hanging out with the wrong people.",

You need Self-Control to keep you focused on the most productive kind of work—that is industriousness. Maintaining self-control is essential to keep friendships healthy and thriving. \r\n\r\nSelf-control is a necessary, delicate balance between your mind, body, and emotions. For a coach and your players, physical acts or mental decisions have a much greater chance to be workable and productive with it than without it. Physical skills are more repeatable at a higher level of performance in the “zone” of self-control. Too much emotion can cause reason to fly out the window. Failing to maintain self-control leads to poor judgement, lack of common sense, and often to serious trouble. \r\n\r\nSelf-control is self-discipline. It starts with how you think and how you discipline yourself to monitor and control the things that most affect and shape your thinking. If your thinking is improperly focused, essentially out of control, it won’t be long till your behavior will follow the same path. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden practiced a remarkable level of self-discipline when it came to his thinking. He used a passage from the Bible as both a guide and a standard: “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things,” Philippians 4:8. Coach Wooden did think about such things, constantly, and it helped him maintain self-control during the heated moments of a sports contest and through the everyday challenges of life.",

He preferred to maintain a gradually increasing level of both performance and emotion. He wanted to avoid creating artificial emotional highs. Every false peak creates a subsequent valley. Self-control provides emotional stability and fewer valleys. \r\n\r\nSelf-control is self-discipline at work. You discipline to help, to correct, to prevent, and to improve. Not to punish, embarrass or retaliate. When you punish, you are likely to antagonize; you cannot get the most positive results when you antagonize. Self-control is essential to avoid the excessive negative emotions that are likely to antagonize. When emotions are high and self-discipline is low, judgement and common sense are going to suffer. Nothing good is likely to happen next. \r\n\r\nSelf-control also keeps you in the present. You cannot let yesterday or tomorrow take up too much of your today.

It makes you aware when you need to take initiative. It attunes you to the things needed to build friendships and strengthen loyalty. It should sound the alarm when friendships are threatened, and loyalty is in jeopardy. To have a fine-tuned radar you must be observing constantly, keep your mind/channels always open, and be eager to learn and improve. \r\n\r\nFor an astute coach, everyone and every situation in your sport and in your life has something to teach you, that might be critical to teach others. Sometimes that lesson is, “how to do something well or better”. Or it may be a lesson such as Abraham Lincoln shared: “People were always teaching me something not to do.” That is still learning and it is alertness at work. Lincoln also said: “The worst thing you can do for those you love are the things they could and should do for themselves.” What a rich lesson for a coach, teacher, mom or dad. \r\n\r\nGrowth comes with responsibility, struggle and grit.

Always observe, which incidentally is easier when you are listening than when you are talking. Not being alert means missed opportunities to learn, to adjust, to do things differently and better. \r\n\r\nAs a coach, making necessary changes in how you practice, what drills you use, what plays you run, and how you best use the talent you have, are all good opportunities to improve your team’s performance. Of course, getting more talented players and mastering the fundamentals will likely bring improvement more quickly. Being alert to the need for change calls for an open mind. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden often counseled that you should not get lost in your own narrow tunnel vision, ego, or selfish ways. All three of these things hinder alertness. Being alert means always leaving room for differences of opinion, possible disagreements, and suggestions from others to make things better. Coach Wooden was very keen on the strength of three ideas when it came to alertness: \r\n1. “What is right is more important than who is right.” \r\n2. “When you are through learning you are through.” \r\n3. “It is what you learn after you know it all that really counts.”",

Initiative takes what you have learned in being alert and enables you to want to do something with what you have learned. Perhaps setting a goal, starting a task, making a change or making an improvement. \r\n\r\nFor a coach, initiative is a game breaker. The definition of initiative is also a powerful reminder from Coach Wooden on how taking initiative works best. “Cultivate the ability to make decisions and think alone.” Ultimately you have to decide and act on a matter. That could mean making big changes. It could mean do nothing. The most important signal in Coach Wooden’s definition is think. Get your brain in gear before you move ahead. Action without quality thinking is a gamble. Thought without action is daydreaming. Inaction is likely fear, apathy, overconfidence, or laziness. \r\n\r\nTaking that first step, exercising initiative, may always feel like there is some element of risk. But risk is lessened when you act with self-control. Preparation lessens risk. Use the information, knowledge, and experience you have. Preparation conquers fear, builds confidence, and fuels initiative. Looking back at times when you have taken initiative can provide important lessons. Here is a lesson Coach Wooden learned in the form of a simple poem: \r\n“When I look back, it seems to me, \r\nAt all the grief that had to be, \r\nLeft me when the pain was gone, \r\nSmarter, stronger, all along.”",

But what Lambert was teaching Wooden was that doers make mistakes, mistakes of commission, not of omission or of carelessness. You want a team of doers. Mistakes shape learning and adversity, and you get stronger and better with adversity. Wooden believed and practiced in a way that challenged his teams to always push to the very edge of potential. Wooden learned that is where growth occurs, adversity teaches, and greatness lies. \r\n\r\nMistakes are great teachers for a coach, a coaching staff, and for players, if you teach from them in a positive way. Recognize mistakes quickly, admit them freely, learn from them immediately, and forget them. In your coaching, if you show initiative, act with good self-control based on careful planning and good information, and if things do not turn out like you hoped, it does not mean you made a bad decision. It just means that decision did not work at that time. The result should never discourage you from taking initiative in the future.",

In fact, he believed, taught and practiced, that you could never be in peak physical condition—the best you are capable of—without being in peak mental and moral condition. For a coach, that idea deserves thoughtful consideration when you plan how you expect your team to become the best conditioned it can be. \r\n\r\nBy condition, Coach Wooden meant physical, mental, moral, and spiritual fitness. Fitness is a high state of readiness that is achieved when you do everything you need to do to perform at your highest level. For Coach Wooden that meant ready to be your best in both sport and life. \r\n\r\nCondition rests on the Self-control and Alertness blocks on the Pyramid. You must maintain your self-control and practice self-discipline to create the habits that will result in top-notch conditioning. You must stay alert to all the things that can improve all types of conditioning; and more importantly, maintaining self-control and alertness will enable you to stay away from anything that will tear you down. \r\n\r\nTrue Success is so much more than just winning. That is why spiritual and moral conditioning is so essential. The physical can only take you so far, particularly when adversity comes into play.

He taught how to do things properly first, and then quickly. Have patience—get things right, then get things moving faster. Everything starts with proper execution of the fundamentals. No detail is too small to consider and to perfect. Preparation is the key to everything.\r\n\r\nSkill comes after Condition on the Pyramid. It was part of the genius of Wooden with the way he combined the two. Everything he planned into his practice routine had a way of improving conditioning and fundamental skills at the same time. His practice preparation and skill building were legendary. At least two hours was spent planning every two-hour practice.* That level of preparation and discipline was maintained for 43 years.

The ability to bring forth the best in others is a set of skills in itself.

Your responsibility as a coach is to put forth your best effort to bring out the best effort in others and help them reach their potential. \r\nNext: Improvement comes from the knowledge to know and teach the fundamentals, and then to get others to properly execute those fundamentals faster and faster, under increasingly competitive conditions. No need to get fancy; just get great at the basics, “be quick but don’t hurry”. \r\nNext: Be relentless at recognizing the details that matter, and don’t forget everything matters.

An eagerness to sacrifice personal glory for the welfare of all. \r\n\r\nTo Wooden very few things were as important as the team concept. No player or coach was above the team. The star of the team was the team. Embracing your role on the team was paramount. Every role was vital. As a teammate, doing your best and helping teammates be their best is as good as it could get. Team Spirit is the ultimate expression of depending on each other. \r\n\r\nTeam Spirit rests on Initiative and Intentness on the Pyramid of Success. That means there is no hesitation to do whatever the team needs. And no one ever lets up or gives up, and will eagerly sacrifice personal interests for the accomplishment of team goals.

His coaches and parents had given him a strong foundation of beliefs and values that taught consideration and respect for everyone. He set the example every day of sacrificing for others and always deferring any credit for success to his players and staff. \r\n\r\nHe modeled what it meant to always put the “we” ahead of the “me”. It is one of a coach’s most important tasks and opportunities to continually celebrate and encourage team play even in the presence of great individual play. Wooden was pleased that his most celebrated individuals were also great team players. They had learned that individuals may achieve honors and recognition, but it took a team to win championships. \r\n\r\nAs a former member of the U.S. Navy during World War II, Wooden had learned what team spirit looked like when our country’s freedom was at stake.

Poise is a composite, a result. \r\n\r\nSeems simple based on Coach Wooden’s definition of poise—just being yourself, just being you. But as a coach and person, who are you? Do you really know? Are you still finding out? Are you comfortable with who you think you are so far? Wooden taught that when we have poise, we are not faking, or acting, or pretending to be something we are not, or someone we are not. Nor are we trying to live up to someone else’s expectations. \r\n\r\nWooden believed and practiced that when we are being who we really are, we have a better chance of functioning nearer our own level of competency. Being yourself eliminates the guesswork. It gets complicated always trying to figure out who you think you are supposed to be, or who you think someone expects you to be. Do you get worried that maybe you don’t fit in? Or perhaps you are trying too hard to stand out? Maybe you think people won’t like or respect you if they know who you really are? Poise keeps you true to yourself. And the real you is the person good people will like and respect.

But more so directing the best of yourself at those things that are truly worth fighting for. \r\n\r\nPoise connects to competitive greatness and that is where the fight comes in. As a coach, you are directing your best and bringing out the best in others to enjoy a difficult challenge. When you have poise, outside influences and outside pressure does not change who you are, what you are trying to be, or what you seek to accomplish. Poise also depends heavily upon two nearby behavior blocks, Self-control and Confidence, which are primary components of poise. \r\n\r\nA poised person has the ability to take a deep breath, compose themselves, and stay in complete control at all times.

Shouldn’t Confidence be one of the foundation blocks, maybe even a cornerstone? \r\n\r\nIn Coach Wooden’s definition of confidence, he does not tell you what confidence is. He tells you what it could create in you and in others: respect. He shares the possibility of how it might be attained. And he shares a state of mind that promotes confidence: keeping all things in proper perspective. \r\n\r\nHis placement of confidence near the top, right next to poise, teaches us a few good things can come out of confidence; competitive greatness, for one. Patience and faith are two others. Confidence is a mental, physical and emotional state of readiness. It occurs when all the behavior below confidence tells you that you are well prepared. \r\n\r\nNot being prepared is a sure predictor of mediocre performance and possibly complete failure.

Faith that things will turn out as they should, if we have done what we should to make things happen. And oh, by the way, we must also be Patient. But we will save that for another lesson. \r\n\r\nWe also see in the construction of the Pyramid of Success, that Faith is one of five pieces of mortar that Coach Wooden placed to cement all the other important blocks in place. In fact, at the top, Faith becomes the fullest extension of what we call that left side of mortar, “the force of the human spirit”: Ambition, Adaptability, Resourcefulness, Fight, and then Faith. \r\n\r\nAs a coach, you can certainly relate to the importance of those four qualities, which we will teach in coming emails. But for now, know that you have to fight for the things you believe in, the things you have faith in. As Coach Wooden practiced faith, that certainly represents a powerful force for good at work. \r\n\r\nIt was very important to Coach Wooden to never come across as someone who was critical of what someone else might believe. He never questioned another person’s faith. It never bothered him if someone believed differently, or if their faith was just as strong as his. He never tried to change another person’s faith. That was not his job. He did encourage his players to have faith, to be able to defend their faith, and to stay open-minded.

In fact, with Coach Wooden as an example, True Success for any coach takes a lifetime. \r\n\r\nJohn Wooden described Patience as the ability to wait and calmly persevere; to him that meant to continue in a course of action even in the face of difficulty. He learned these lessons early as a young man on the family farm. He was taught about a time to plant, a time to cultivate and water. And barring any major disaster, a time to harvest. The planting, watering, weeding and cultivation are always hard work, but without those stages, there is no harvest. \r\n\r\nFor a coach, whether it is developing a program, a culture, a tradition over a long period of time—or if it’s the development of a team preparing for a single season—the same principles apply.

All great things take even longer. And the pursuit of perfection is never ending. Patience holds this reality together and keeps you optimistic, as you pursue the only path that will get you there. That path is day-to-day improvement. Easy to say, but much, much harder to do, staying on course and staying constructively optimistic. In an increasingly impatient world, where the desire for instant recognition, winning at all costs, fame and fortune, has never been more pressing, patience seems to be in short supply. It is harder and harder to wait and to keep others waiting for the necessary progress to reach the end result. \r\n\r\nIt is also difficult in an instant gratification culture, to have the proper perspective needed to balance the instant joy of winning the game, with the more important task of helping those you coach to build the skills needed to win at life. Coach Wooden often told the story about famous football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, who was once asked after a very successful season, “Well Coach, how do you think your season went?” His answer: “Well, I won’t really know for about twenty years.” Patience is a behavior that takes maturity and wisdom to fully develop. You might say becoming patient takes patience. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden observed young people may be more impatient. They want things to happen quickly. They may see all change as progress. As you get older and a little more set in your ways, you become more adverse and skeptical about change. You may hold on tighter to what you think and how you get things done. But even Coach John Wooden—a very patient coach, with a clear formula for repeatable success, at the highest competitive level—kept making changes, for he knew, “there is no progress without change”.",

If we are going to invest time carefully planning and working hard, then that effort should be focused on doing things that really matter. \r\n\r\nAccomplishing things that are noble goals will take the self-discipline, good judgement and common sense required to exhibit self-control. Ambition connects to Adaptability which tells us we will have to be adaptable in many ways to accomplish our noble goals. \r\n\r\nWhat are things that represent noble goals? Coach Wooden believed you are most likely to succeed when your intentions, your ambition, is focused on worthy purposes and outcomes rather than goals that are set out of selfishness. How do you know the difference? Here is Coach Wooden’s yardstick: If your ambition is to be highly publicized, widely recognized, attain a position of power or prestige, or make a lot of money, you likely do not have noble goals. \r\n\r\nIf you are focused away from yourself, focused on your team, your staff, your community, on helping others get along and get ahead, then you possess noble goals. When you possess noble goals, you prioritize the bigger picture. Having noble goals means you are taking others along on your climb up The Pyramid of Success. \r\n\r\nSo what you are ambitious about determines whether ambition is good or bad.

Make no mistake about it, John Wooden wanted to win a National Championship. He set goals that he thought might eventually put his teams in the position to win one. In all humility, he said he thought that turned out pretty well. Winning ten National Championships in 12 years certainly proves his point. But he also says that he would have been at ease if he had not won a championship, because his significance and self-worth were never attached to winning. He just wanted himself as a person, and his team and players to improve.

Adaptability precedes Resourcefulness, suggesting that the more adaptable we are, the better we will be able to recognize our circumstances and better allocate the resources we have. Adaptability is more than recognizing circumstances that call for us to adjust. Adaptability is the will to act, making needed adjustments to any situation at any given time. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden often remarked that there are only three things you can really count on in life: death, taxes, and change. He always tried to see change as something not to fear or complain about. But change is an opportunity to do three things: Recognize it, grow with it, and learn from it. \r\n\r\nSince change is inevitable, if you are inflexible, bull-headed, or stubborn as a person or coach, you will never become all that you could become, to be your best and help others be their best. As a coach, leader and mentor, you must readily adapt to circumstances as they unfold.

If you fail to adapt, you fail to move forward. Being adaptable and flexible is a must. Not only as you move from one season to another, but as you try to make the best of every day. For Coach Wooden that meant “make each day your masterpiece”. \r\n\r\nAs a coach, making the best of each day means you are adapting to so many things each season. Every day of the season brings the need for adaptability. The players you are working with, budgets, facilities, parents, conference regulations, rule changes, changing values, social media—what a dynamic it all creates! \r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the changing circumstances this dynamic creates, you must be constantly surveying the situation and then making necessary adjustments. Random adjustments on the fly are less effective than adjustments to a solid plan. Planning is preparation that builds confidence for being adaptable. Planning will help you anticipate changes that could come. \r\n\r\nYou change what you can when you can. But you cannot get so engrossed in circumstances over which you have no control, that it takes time and energy away from changes you can make. Ultimately things happen, changes occur ,and you have to recognize and accept reality and move forward. In fact, things will always turn out best for those who make the best of how things turn out.

That thinking called for resourcefulness to find answers that fit the different circumstances and different people. \r\n\r\nAs a coach you likely have staff members and players who are either part of the solution or likely making excuses. It is the creative energy, effort and ideas spawned by resourcefulness that keeps things focused on solutions. \r\n\r\nIt was American Ambassador and Statesman Dwight Morrow, who stated “There are no hopeless situations, only hopeless people.” With resourcefulness, there is always the opportunity to find the will, \r\nforge the way, and spawn hope. Resourcefulness can provide an answer at any time, that can come from anywhere, and from any person. Wooden always sought after and respected the thinking and solutions of others. That is why Coach Wooden was fond of the maxims “a good place to find a helping hand is at the end of your arm”, and “others too have brains”. \r\n\r\nCoach Wooden stayed pure in his approach to finding answers to difficult problems.

He knew the word has some negative connotations that he did not want to communicate. The word conjures up images of two people or two teams or perhaps even two countries going against each other. He is being crystal clear when he states “in no way is this mortar quality about an opponent”. There was a time when he talked about being better than an opponent, but he stopped that. He always wanted to win, but the fight was never with an opponent. The fight was always within himself. Fight was the struggle inside to produce the passion, energy, effort it took to be the best you can be. Wooden’s view was there is no such thing as losing when you give the effort to do the best you can. If you use Fight and determination to give your very best, winning and success will take care of itself. Determination is the key idea. It is having that iron will and clear sense of purpose that it takes to “never say never”. As one of the mortar blocks that holds Competitive Greatness in place, Fight means that you welcome and even relish adversity, and situations that could bring adversity. Adversity builds both moral and competitive strength. Fight means you are never afraid of failure. Because of that you will seldom have to face it. Fight enables you and your teams to mentally and physically get up for the big game. The joy of competition means every game is a big game.",

These four blocks define strength of character. They also can help bring people together and bond them as loyal, cooperative friends. To be successful you must interact with others. Sincerity helps ensure that those interactions will be positive and productive. Coach Wooden was not totally sure that sincerity would make you a friend. He was convinced, however, that sincerity is essential to keep your friends. It often takes time to know who someone really is. Can they be trusted? Are they consistent in their values and actions? Do they say what they mean and mean what they say? Can you count on them to do what they say they will do? When you see that people are sincere in thought, word and actions, you more than likely respond by giving back what you have been given. As a military man, John Wooden had seen that soldiers following a sincere leader would do more for him or her than for an insincere one, especially under fire. He found sincerity worked the same way with an athletic team. Players will always give more to a coach who really cares about them, than one just using the team and the opportunity to get ahead themselves. A coach can only give their best when they sincerely care for those whom they have the privilege to serve. When players believe their coach really cares about them as individuals, they will make the effort to get closer to their personal best. Sincerity is the bond that holds all of this together.",

Perhaps as a coach you have experienced some level of success causing resentment in some other people. It always seems there are people who want to bring you down and keep you down. Others strive to keep you from ever moving up. These are not likely sincere people or sincere friends. There will always be people that don’t like you or will always disagree with something you have said or done. Those situations give you a chance to test and strengthen your own level of sincerity. You can reach out to those people in all sincerity and attempt to reconcile a situation, or mend some feelings; but often it is to no avail and differences become un-mended fences that keep people apart. Sincerity is not a guarantee that all personal relationships will be positive and strong. Insincerity is, however, very likely a guarantee that communication between people will not be meaningful and any relationship is likely to be shallow.

These four blocks represent “the strength of human character”. The second of these blocks is Honesty, which Coach Wooden specifies, “in thought and action”. That means doing the things you know are right and not giving in to the temptation to do things you know are wrong. Honesty keeps you on a narrow path, regardless of the consequences. Combined with the desire to be reliable, honesty drives the integrity it takes to never make compromises with your values and principles. Honesty means you don’t lie to others or yourself. A dishonest act is always a selfish act. It is always an attempt to deceive someone for personal gain in some way. It might be to get something you want, or to protect something you have, or to keep someone else from taking advantage of you, or to provide a payback for something done to you. Dishonesty, no matter what the reason, destroys your credibility, ruins your reputation, and ultimately costs you your self-respect. With peace of mind as the ultimate reward for true success, the cost of dishonesty could not be higher. Since Honesty rests between Intentness and Team Spirit, Coach Wooden emphasizes how important Honesty is to attaining high performance. Maximum effort focused on realistic goals, resisting the temptations that undermine achievement, and sacrificing personal interests for a greater good will never take place if any dishonesty plagues your mind, your heart and your actions. Honesty must be a core strength, an uncompromised discipline in your mind and heart that guides every action, every day.",

Coach John Wooden shared and wrote on more than one occasion that during his time at UCLA, he was tempted to be dishonest many times. Mostly he resisted. But he does recount several incidents that he was not very proud of his own, not very Pyramid-like behavior. On one occasion, an opposing coach kept sending the wrong shooter—a better shooter—to the free throw line. He got away with it several times so Coach Wooden set his honesty aside and tried it. He got caught. He was embarrassed, certainly. But he was more regretful for giving in to the temptation, and not staying true to his standards. On another occasion, he violated college basketball rules when he bailed Bill Walton out of jail. He broke the rules to do what he thought was best for the player. He never tried to hide the fact. He was prepared to face the consequences. He felt he was honest about both his reasons and his actions. Wooden believed and taught that being tempted to be dishonest is not the problem. Everyone faces temptation quite often. The lesson is how to resist the temptation when it comes. Resisting temptation is a conscious act, carried out by disciplined thinking. Disciplined thinking, well developed, will produce disciplined behavior. Honesty is always the best policy, as the saying goes. Coach Wooden learned that very early when his dad gave him a set of three Nevers: Never Lie, Never Cheat, Never Steal! He also learned Honesty is the best therapy. It makes you feel good about who you are. That explains why he was fond of the maxim “there is no pillow as soft as a clear conscience”.",

Team Members that can depend on each other all the time will be more considerate of each other and have more confidence in each other. Members of a coaching staff that are rigorous in their preparation build confidence among each other, and with their team. They model what reliability is all about. John Wooden demonstrated that with two hours of preparation for every two-hour practice with his staff.* Reliability creates mutual respect. The kind of respect that produces dependability and consistency. Team members learn from coaches and each other to give their best, and to do their best in every situation. Coach Wooden learned so many early lessons on what reliability looks like on an everyday basis from his first coaches: his parents. Their hard work, steadfastness, and consistency during very trying times, even when they lost the family farm, demonstrated they would be there for their family, no matter what. Wooden saw the same admirable behavior from the three coaches—Warner, Curtis and Lambert—that shaped his coaching philosophy. As a great player who became a great coach, Wooden could never fathom the idea of letting somebody down. He tried to teach his players that this meant so much more than just showing up for practice and games. As representatives of the University, the community, and the team, it also meant never putting yourself in a position where your character and behavior compromise your values. You could never do something that would let those people down who are depending on you. His advice “discipline yourself so others won’t need to” reinforced the importance of reliability.",

The message here is that to be a person of Integrity, you must also be a highly reliable person. You can always be counted on to do what you said you would do, even if circumstances change and things become more difficult. Conversely, the “purity of intentions” that define Integrity, is not likely to be part of the behavior of a person you cannot depend on. Many people have the best of intentions, to do the right things, but just never quite follow through and never get the job done. It is the combination of intention and action that really makes the difference. That is why Coach Wooden was fond of the quote “the smallest good deed is better than the best intention”. Reliability is also not to be confused with capability. Coach Wooden did not think capability had anything to do with reliability. In fact, his experience as a coach and leader strengthened that notion. He had players who may have been less capable, but their reliability, their consistency of action and effort often made up for their state of less God-given talent. For a coach, knowing what you are going to get every day from a player or assistant is valuable. You know what you can count on. Excellent talent that comes with inconsistent performance makes a coach’s job more difficult. Reliability is a trademark behavior of good character. Coach Wooden often remarked, “ability may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep you there”. Reliability eliminates the idea that you can ever rest on your laurels. Winning ten national championships in 12 years certainly proved Coach Wooden’s team had great capability. Perhaps less celebrated was the critical fact they and he had even greater reliability.",

Webster takes four times that number to define Integrity: “the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness.” Another definition: “the state of being whole and undivided”. Purity of intention, as Coach Wooden understood it, was always a reflection of the condition of your heart and soul. It means being true to your values, your guiding principles and core beliefs. It means always having a clear conscience. Integrity pulls from other character qualities and reflects sincerity, honesty and reliability. When these qualities come together for you as a coach and in your personal life, you will always want to do what is right, when you know what is right. Every coach is different, just as every person playing on your team is different. That means a lot of differing values; it might mean conflicting values. Coach Wooden focused on those things he felt were absolutes. Things like the Ten Commandments reflected his absolutes. When we violate those things that are the absolutes we choose, we fail as coaches and people of integrity. Being true to yourself only makes you a person of integrity when you stay true to your absolutes. In a team environment that you are responsible for shaping, everyone must be clear on just what your absolutes are.

Coach Wooden felt, and experienced, that the more the quality of integrity was represented in the make-up of his team, the better their team play would become. Great players who lacked integrity didn’t usually form great teams, but there were some exceptions. Wooden had great players who were everything he hoped they would be on the court; they were reliable, committed, high performers. But off the court, he sometimes saw examples of “selective integrity”; choices that were made, and actions taken, that kept someone from being all they could be off the court. The quality of integrity, Coach Wooden thought, is best reflected when someone is genuinely concerned with the betterment of others. In his mind, the integrity of commitment, to regard others as more important than yourself, is what really sets someone apart. Coach Wooden had five examples or role models he would reference when it came to integrity: Jesus, Joshua Wooden, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, and Billy Graham. Very high standards for anyone to emulate, certainly, but worth giving your best effort. Coach Wooden especially liked how Mother Theresa expressed it: “a life not lived for others is not a life”. Living a life for others means we are whole, complete, unimpaired. It means we are reflecting good moral principles.

He has introduced you to much of his life’s work, his experience and wisdom that comprised his personal system of human performance behavior: The Pyramid of Success. This unique behavioral blueprint that took 14 years to finalize, and seven decades to practice, perfect, and prove its immense worth. Now as a reminder for you, and a summary of the Pyramid of Success, we answer a question. Coach Wooden was asked many times and always answered with the same response: Can a person and a team truly achieve Success by following the Pyramid of Success? How does that happen? “Well, of course they can. If they are industriousness, giving their best effort and having a plan. If they have enthusiasm, loving what they do. If they have and value friendship and show loyalty to someone and some things. If they practice cooperation, always wanting to find the best way, not always interested in having their own way. “If they maintain self-control and use good judgement, always showing alertness, taking initiative, and setting and accomplishing realistic goals. They must of course maintain condition, mental, moral and physical, and have the skills to do things not only quickly, but properly. They must have team spirit, always showing consideration for others. “All the qualities I mention will provide the poise to just be yourself, and the confidence it takes for competitive greatness—enjoying the difficult challenge and being your best when your best is needed. But all this will not happen overnight. It takes a spirited person of strong character, who has the faith to know things will work out, when they do what they must. And it always requires patience.
